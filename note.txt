awesome—what should we tackle next? here are some good options you can pick from (or tell me something else):

1. Scientific Program

   * day-wise list + hall filters + search
   * bookmark toggle + “My Schedule”
   * local reminder scheduling (client-side)

2. Notifications

   * auto-refresh (polling) every X min
   * “mark all read” + badge count on tab

3. Dashboard

   * API-driven buttons with icons
   * open links in in-app WebView + deep-links

4. Faculty & Committee

   * search by name/city/designation
   * alphabetical index + fast scroll

5. Auth UX

   * form validation + error toasts
   * remember me + auto-login

6. Build/Release

   * production EAS profiles (apk/aab)
   * environment switching (dev/stage/prod)

7. Backend

   * cron to send “10-min before” session notifications
   * admin-safe endpoints & logs

which one do you want to start with?
